# Introduction

This sample contains a Kotlin application designed for Surface Duo. The application is an HTML
 editor that enables real-time rendering of formatted source code. Making use of the
 [Dual View](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/introduction#dual-view)
 app pattern, users are able to edit and preview any changes simultaneously without switching
 windows.

## Getting Started

To learn how to load your app on to emulator, and to use it, see the full documentation here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen)

## Features

This project uses [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments), one to display a code editing window and another to render and display formatted code through a [WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView). The app starts in single screen mode, but can be spanned to enable dual screen mode. See the Getting Started section above for more information about spanning.
